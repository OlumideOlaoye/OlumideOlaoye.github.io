								<p>As a Data Scientist in a non-governmental organization, I was tasked with predicting climate change and impacts in Africa and report the state of climate change at the upcoming African Union Summit. On this task, I utilized some machine learning algorithms to predict the climate changes in the year 2025 across the regions discovered in the dataset.</p>

											The combined data source integrates information from four distinct tables, providing a comprehensive overview of various aspects related to the organization's workforce. The combined data source thus offers a holistic view of the organization's workforce dynamics, encompassing employee feedback, job structure, office locations, and attrition information. This integrated dataset enables a more comprehensive analysis of the relationships and trends within the organization over time</p>

								<p>Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, I gathered data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assessed its quality and tidiness, then cleaned it. I documented my wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcased them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries).

									The dataset that I wrangled (analyzed and visualized) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.
										
									WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively for me to use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017</p>

								<a href="https://github.com/OlumideTheAnalyst/Communicate-Data-Findings-Udacity-Project" class="image fit"><img src="images/prosper_loan_communicate.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>In this project, I wanted to look at the features of loans that could be used to predict their Borrower APR. The main emphasis was on the Loan Original Amount, borrower's Prosper Rating (Alpha), loan term (Term), and borrower's Stated Monthly Income. 
										
									The dataset consisted of Borrower APRs and attributes of 113,937 loans. The attributes included Loan Original Amount, borrower's Prosper Rating (Alpha), loan term (Term), borrower's Stated Monthly Income, as well as many other features such as borrower's Employment Status, Debt To Income Ratio, Current Loan Status, etc. 352 data points were removed from the analysis due to very large stated monthly income that seemed as outliers and missing borrower APR information.
									
									I utilized Python libary visualization packages - matplotlib and seaborn to provide interesting insights and relationships among the loan features and their effects on the Borrower APR.</p>

								<p>The primary goal of the project is to go through the general data analysis process — using basic data analysis technique with NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib. The movie dataset, which is originally from Kaggle, was cleaned and provided by Udacity. According Kaggle introduction page, the data contains information that are provided from The Movie Database (TMDb). It collects 5000+ movies basic move information and movie matrices, including user ratings, popularity and revenue data. These metrics can be seen as how successful these movies are. The movie basic information contained like cast, director, keywords, runtime, genres, etc.</p>
